# Vini AI

Vini AI is a rebranded local agent runtime built from the MIT-licensed Agent Zero project.

Upstream attribution is preserved in `LICENSE` and Vini AI workspace docs.
### A full Linux system for your AI agent.

Vini AI is an open, dynamic, organic agentic framework. One Docker container ships a full Linux system with a desktop and a plugin hub that the agent can extend using Skills.

# What Makes Vini AI Different

## A Real Linux Desktop in the Canvas

<img alt="Vini AI driving Blender in its built-in XFCE desktop" src="docs/res/usage/webui/agentzero-xfce-computer.gif" />
<br>

Vini AI opens its own Linux desktop inside the right-side Canvas. Not a remote VM, not a shared clipboard, but a real XFCE desktop session running in the container.

That means the agent can drive *real desktop software*: open Blender to model a 3D object, jump into a terminal window, manage files visually, run a GUI tool that has no API.

You watch every action, and you can intervene at any moment because your mouse and keyboard share the same desktop.

See the [Desktop guide](./docs/guides/desktop.md) for the walkthrough, prompt examples, and how Desktop differs from Browser.

## Native Browser With DOM Annotations

<img alt="Annotating a webpage element in the Vini AI browser" src="docs/res/usage/browser/annotation.gif" />
<br>

Vini AI ships a built-in Browser with an optional live surface in the Canvas. The agent can open pages, read them, click, type, upload files, and take screenshots - the usual. The unusual part is **Annotate mode**.

Annotate mode turns any webpage into an interactive directive surface. Click an element to:

- **Change it** - "make this button blue and round the corners" runs as a JS instruction the agent applies and verifies.
- **Inspect it** - pull the DOM, the styles, the parent chain, the framework hints into the conversation.
- **Lift it** - see a card, hero, or component on someone else's site that you like? Capture it and have the agent re-implement it in your own project's stack.
- **Comment it** - leave actionable notes pinned to elements during a UI review; the agent reads the comments and ships the fixes.

The Docker browser is the default live Browser surface. Browser history keeps screenshots of important steps, so older chats can still show what the agent saw. The Browser also supports Chrome extensions inside the Docker browser, and **Bring Your Own Browser** through the A0 CLI Connector lets the agent drive Chrome/Edge/Chromium on your own machine.

See the [Browser guide](./docs/guides/browser.md) for screenshots, settings, host-browser setup, and troubleshooting.

## Cowork on Documents

### Markdown Editor With Live Cowork

<img alt="Vini AI writing a TODO plan in the Canvas markdown editor" src="docs/res/usage/webui/markdown-editor.gif" />
<br>

The Canvas includes a rich Markdown editor designed for genuine cowork. Ask the agent to "write a plan to do X in a TODO.md in the open doc" and you'll see the file appear in the editor, character by character, while you keep typing in another section.

It's not a preview pane. It's a real editor with toolbar, formatting buttons, tables, and an editable source view - built so that the agent's edits and yours are equal first-class operations on the same document.

Use it for plans, TODOs, meeting notes, RFCs, project handoffs, or any artifact where the deliverable should *live as text* rather than be trapped inside chat scrollback.

### LibreOffice Integration

LibreOffice Writer, Calc, and Impress are wired up so you can type by hand while Vini AI creates, updates, saves, and verifies the same files in real time.

ODT, ODS, and ODP binary formats are first-class citizens in the Vini AI Desktop environment to align with the Open Document Format (ODF).

Use the Desktop toolbar to create and edit Writer, Spreadsheet, and Presentation LibreOffice files.

## Plugin Hub - 100+ Community Plugins

<img alt="Vini AI Plugin Hub showing community plugins" src="docs/res/usage/plugins/plugin-hub-browse.png" />
<br>

Vini AI is built for extension, not just configuration. The built-in **Plugin Hub** browses a growing catalog of community plugins - currently more than 100, covering:

- **Development frameworks** like the [BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/bmad-method) (full software development lifecycle with 20 specialist agents) and [Agent Skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills).
- **Memory systems** - alternative memory backends, intelligent consolidation strategies, vector recall plugins.
- **Tools and integrations** - embedded terminals, custom browsers, deployment helpers, API clients.
- **UI extensions** - chat rename controls, sidebar tweaks, theme packs, custom Canvas panels.
- **Workflow plugins** - schedulers, multi-agent orchestration, project automations.

Install with a click from the Web UI, or publish your own to the index repository. Combined with custom prompts in `prompts/`, custom tools in `tools/`, MCP servers, A2A connectors, and project-scoped configuration, Vini AI gives you a real surface area to shape the agent into whatever you need.

See the [Skills guide](./docs/guides/skills.md), the [Create a Small Plugin](./docs/guides/create-plugin.md) tutorial, and the [MCP setup](./docs/guides/mcp-setup.md) guide.

## Use Your OpenAI Codex Plan

<img alt="OAuth LLM plans in Vini AI" src="docs/res/codex-screenshot.png" />
<br>

Vini AI connects to your OpenAI Codex plan through the new OAuth flow. Sign in with your account, pick the Codex-backed provider, and let Vini AI use the plan you already have. Click "Connect", enter the device code in the OpenAI page, choose your model, and you're set.

This is the first step toward account-backed LLM plans in Vini AI. More integrations are coming, including Gemini CLI and Claude Code through extra-usage.

## A0 CLI Connector: Extend Onto Your Host Machine

<img alt="A0 CLI driving the host browser through a Google Cloud VM creation flow" src="docs/res/usage/a0-cli/host-browser.gif" />
<br>

The **A0 CLI Connector** is not a separate CLI agent. It connects to a running Vini AI instance and gives that instance a terminal-native bridge to your host machine - so the same agent (with all its memory, projects, and skills) can also work on real files outside the Docker container.

Install the connector on the machine you want Vini AI to work on, **not** inside the Vini AI container.

### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -LsSf https://cli.agent-zero.ai/install.sh | sh
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
irm https://cli.agent-zero.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then run `a0` to connect your terminal to an existing Vini AI instance. It can usually discover a local instance automatically, or you can point it at a remote URL hosted somewhere else, such as a VPS or tunnel.

This is especially useful if you:

- prefer CLI workflows;
- want Vini AI to work in an existing local repository;
- are running Vini AI on a remote server;
- want Docker isolation for Vini AI while still granting explicit, controlled access to host-side work.

For full setup, see the [A0 CLI Connector guide](https://www.agent-zero.ai/p/docs/a0-cli-connector/) (or the [in-repo guide](./docs/guides/a0-cli-connector.md)).

## Projects, Skills, Agent Profiles, and Model Presets

**Projects** isolate workspaces, instructions, memory, secrets, knowledge, repositories, and model presets. Clone a public or private Git repo into a project and give the agent context that belongs to that work alone.

**Skills** can be loaded on demand by Vini AI, or pinned from the chat input when you want a specific procedure to stay active.

**Agent Profiles** change the broader working style of the current chat.

**Model Presets** are named shortcuts for model setups, so you can quickly switch between fast, balanced, cheap, local, or high-power model choices.

## Multi-Agent Cooperation

Every agent can create subordinate agents to break down work. The superior gives tasks and receives reports; subagents keep their own contexts focused and return their findings when done.

This makes Vini AI useful for research, software engineering, data analysis, plugin development, and tasks where several specialized perspectives are better than one overloaded context.

## Transparent and Extensible by Design

Almost nothing is hidden. Prompts live in `prompts/`, tools live in `tools/` or plugins, and built-in behavior can be inspected, changed, replaced, or extended.

Vini AI supports plugins, MCP, A2A, custom tools, custom prompts, project-scoped configuration, environment-based deployment settings, and a Web UI designed to keep the agent's work readable in real time.

## Try These First

- **Annotate a design you like:** "Open this template site in the Browser. I'll annotate the hero section - re-implement it in my project's React + Tailwind stack."
- **Cowork on a spreadsheet:** "Create an editable ODS budget model with assumptions and monthly projections."
- **Drive a desktop app:** "Use the Linux Desktop to open Blender and create a simple 3D logo for me."
- **Review a web UI:** "Open my local app in the Browser. I will annotate the page with comments; then implement the requested UI fixes."
- **Create a specialist:** "Create an Agent Profile for financial analysis with cautious reasoning, clear assumptions, and spreadsheet-first deliverables."
- **Recover a workspace:** "Show me recent Time Travel snapshots and explain what changed before I revert anything."

## Vini AI and Space Agent

Vini AI is the open framework and Linux-powered agent workbench.

[Space Agent](https://github.com/agent0ai/space-agent) is our newer product direction for the agent-shaped workspace: a Space the agent can reshape from inside your browser, with live demos, a desktop app, and a path to running a real server for yourself or your team.

</p>

If you want the raw power and deep customizability of an agent with a full Linux system, start here with Vini AI. If you want the polished Space experience for easier personal, team, desktop, or self-hosted use, explore [Space Agent](https://github.com/agent0ai/space-agent).


## Time Travel (powered by Space Agent)

Time Travel gives Vini AI-owned `/a0/usr` workspaces snapshot history, diff inspection, travel, and revert. It is designed for recoverable agent work: see what changed, compare files, inspect a past state, and roll back when needed. Try it in Space Agent as well (link above).

<img alt="Time Travel" src="docs/res/time-travel.png" />

It is not a replacement for Git or backups. It is a practical safety layer for the workspace where agents are actively creating and editing files.

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Software engineering:** inspect a codebase, make scoped edits, run tests, explain tradeoffs, and keep a recoverable history of file changes.
- **Host-machine development:** connect with `a0` and let Vini AI work in your real local repositories, or clone them through Git Projects feature in the Web UI.
- **Design inspiration and UI iteration:** browse the web, annotate elements you like, and pull components into your own stack.
- **Financial analysis and charting:** collect data, correlate events, create spreadsheets, and generate editable charts.
- **Office deliverables:** cowork on documents, spreadsheets, and presentation decks instead of trapping the result in chat text.
- **Web and mobile QA:** browse an app, annotate UI issues, install browser extensions, and turn visual comments into actionable fixes.
- **API integration:** paste an API snippet, let the agent build a working example, and store the pattern for future use.
- **Client/project isolation:** keep memory, secrets, instructions, files, and model choices separated by project.
- **Scheduled operations:** run recurring checks and monitoring tasks with project-scoped context and credentials.

## Safety Model

Vini AI is powerful because it can use a real environment.

- Keep it running inside Docker or another isolated environment.
- Do not mount your entire home directory unless you understand the risk.
- Grant A0 CLI Read+Write access and remote code execution only for machines and workspaces you trust.
- Store credentials in project secrets or settings, not in prompts or public files.
- Review actions that touch accounts, money, production systems, or private data.
- Keep backups for important workspaces.
