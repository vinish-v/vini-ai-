# Vini AI - Plugins Guide

This guide covers the Python Backend and Frontend Web UI plugin architecture. Use this as the definitive reference for building and extending Vini AI.

---

## 1. Architecture Overview

Vini AI uses a convention-over-configuration plugin model where runtime capabilities are discovered from the directory structure.

### Internal Components

1. Backend discovery (python/helpers/plugins.py): Resolves roots (usr/plugins/ first, then plugins/) and builds the effective set of plugins.
2. Path resolution (python/helpers/subagents.py): Injects plugin paths into the agent's search space for prompts, tools, and configurations.
3. Python extensions (python/helpers/extension.py): Executes named lifecycle hooks from `extensions/python/<point>/` and implicit `@extensible` hooks from `extensions/python/_functions/<module>/<qualname>/<start|end>/`.
4. Web UI extensions (webui/js/extensions.js): Injects HTML/JS contributions into core UI breakpoints (x-extension).

---

## 2. File Structure

Each plugin lives in usr/plugins/<plugin_name>/.

```text

```

### Python extension layouts

Use one of these backend extension layouts, depending on what you are extending:

- `extensions/python/<extension_point>/` for named lifecycle hooks such as `system_prompt`, `monologue_start`, or `tool_execute_before`
- `extensions/python/_functions/<module>/<qualname>/<start|end>/` for implicit `@extensible` call sites

The `_functions` layout preserves every module segment and every nested `__qualname__` segment. Do not use the retired flattened form `extensions/python/<module>_<qualname>_<start|end>/`; those folder names no longer match the runtime lookup logic.

### Python import rule for user plugins

For plugin-local Python code in `usr/plugins/<plugin_name>/`, import through the
fully qualified `usr.plugins.<plugin_name>...` package path.

Good (DO):

```python
from usr.plugins.my_plugin.helpers.runtime import do_work
import usr.plugins.my_plugin.helpers.state as state
```

Avoid (DON'T):

```python
# sys.path hacks
sys.path.insert(0, ...)
from helpers.runtime import do_work

# persistent symlink-based imports
from plugins.my_plugin.helpers.runtime import do_work
```

Why:

- `usr.plugins...` works without renaming `helpers/`
- it avoids `sys.path` mutation for plugin-local imports
- it avoids installation-time symlinks into `/a0/plugins/`
- it keeps plugin removal reversible, with no import wiring left behind

### plugin.yaml (runtime manifest)

This is the manifest file that lives inside your plugin directory and drives runtime behavior. It is distinct from the index manifest (`index.yaml`) used when publishing to the Plugin Index (see Section 7).

```yaml
name: my_plugin              # required for community plugins (^[a-z0-9_]+$, must match dir name)
title: My Plugin
description: What this plugin does.
version: 1.0.0
settings_sections:
  - agent
per_project_config: false
per_agent_config: false
# Optional: lock plugin permanently ON in UI/back-end
always_enabled: false
```

Field reference:
- `name`: Plugin identifier. Required by CI when submitting to the Plugin Index. Must be `^[a-z0-9_]+$` and match the index folder name exactly.
- `title`: UI display name
- `description`: Short plugin summary
- `version`: Plugin version string
- `settings_sections`: Which Settings tabs show a subsection for this plugin. Valid values: `agent`, `external`, `mcp`, `developer`, `backup`. Use `[]` for no subsection.
- `per_project_config`: Enables project-scoped settings and toggle rules
- `per_agent_config`: Enables agent-profile-scoped settings and toggle rules
- `always_enabled`: Forces ON and disables toggle controls in the UI (reserved for framework use)

### execute.py (plugin script)

Plugins can include an optional `execute.py` file at the plugin root for user-triggered work such as setup, post-install steps, maintenance, migrations, repair flows, or resource refreshes. It is started manually from the Plugins UI, never automatically, and should print progress while returning `0` on success.

Design guidance:
- use `execute.py` for manual operations the user may need to run again later
- prefer making it rerunnable or state-aware
- avoid placing framework-internal automatic behavior here; that belongs in `hooks.py` or lifecycle extensions
- do not make permanent system modifications that remain after plugin deletion unless the user explicitly asked for them and the plugin also provides a clear cleanup path

### hooks.py (framework runtime hooks)

Plugins can include an optional `hooks.py` file at the plugin root. Vini AI loads this module on demand and calls exported functions by name through `helpers.plugins.call_plugin_hook(...)`.

- `hooks.py` runs inside the **Vini AI framework runtime and Python environment**, not the separate agent execution environment.
- Use it for framework-internal operations such as install-time setup, pre-update cleanup or preparation, plugin registration work, filesystem preparation, cache updates, or other tasks that need access to Vini AI internals.
- Hook functions may be synchronous or async. Async hooks are awaited by the framework.
- Hook modules are cached until plugin caches are cleared, so changes may require a plugin refresh/reload cycle.
- Plugin hooks should be cleanup-safe. A plugin should not leave behind permanent system modifications, symlinks, files outside its owned paths, or background services that survive plugin removal unless that behavior is explicitly part of the user-facing contract.

Current built-in usage:
- the plugin installer calls `install()` from `hooks.py` after a plugin is copied into place
- the plugin updater calls `pre_update()` from `hooks.py` immediately before pulling new plugin code into place

### Runtime and dependency implications

- If `hooks.py` installs Python packages with `sys.executable -m pip`, those packages are installed into the **same Python environment that runs Vini AI itself**.
- This is the correct place for Python dependencies that your plugin's backend code needs while running inside the framework runtime.
- It is **not** the right place for dependencies meant only for the separate agent execution runtime or for arbitrary system-level tooling.

If your plugin needs to install packages or binaries for the agent execution environment instead of the framework runtime, launch a subprocess that explicitly activates or targets that other environment first. In practice this means invoking the correct interpreter or shell for that environment rather than relying on the current process environment. For example:

- target a specific Python interpreter path for that runtime
- activate the desired virtualenv inside a subprocess shell command before running `pip`
- invoke the appropriate package manager from a subprocess prepared for that environment

In Docker deployments, this distinction is especially important:

- Framework runtime: `/opt/venv-a0`
- Agent execution runtime: `/opt/venv`

So a `hooks.py` install step affects `/opt/venv-a0` unless you intentionally switch to `/opt/venv` (or another target) inside your subprocess.

## 3. Frontend Extensions

### HTML Breakpoints
Core UI defines insertion points like <x-extension id="sidebar-quick-actions-main-start"></x-extension>.
To contribute:
1. Place HTML files in extensions/webui/<extension_point>/.
2. Include a root x-data scope.
3. Include an x-move-* directive (e.g., x-move-to-start, x-move-after="#id").

### JS Hooks
Place *.js files in extensions/webui/<extension_point>/ and export a default async function. They are called via callJsExtensions("<point>", context).

Core JS hooks can also expose runtime UI surfaces when static HTML breakpoints are not a fit. For example, `confirm_dialog_after_render` runs after the shared confirm dialog is built and receives the rendered dialog/body/footer nodes plus any caller-provided `extensionContext`.

For tool chat rows (`type === "tool"`), after built-in badge rules, core calls `get_tool_message_handler` with a mutable object containing `tool_name`, `kvps`, and `handler`. Plugins can set `handler` to entirely take over rendering for their `_tool_name`. A plugin can import `drawMessageToolSimple` and call it internally (e.g., passing `{ ...args, code: "WWW" }`) if it just wants standard tool row styling with a custom badge.

### User Feedback: Notifications, Not Inline Errors
Plugin UI must use the **A0 notification system** for errors, success, and warnings. Do not render dedicated error/success boxes (e.g. a red block bound to `store.error`). Use the notification store so toasts and notification history stay consistent across the app.

- **Frontend (Alpine/store)**: Import `toastFrontendError`, `toastFrontendSuccess`, `toastFrontendWarning`, `toastFrontendInfo` from `/components/notifications/notification-store.js`, or call `$store.notificationStore.frontendError(message, title)` etc.
- **Backend (Python)**: Use `AgentNotification.error(...)`, `AgentNotification.success(...)` from `helpers.notification`.

See [Notifications](../developer/notifications.md) for the full API.

## 4. Plugin Settings

1. Add webui/config.html to your plugin.
2. The plugin settings wrapper instantiates a local modal context from $store.pluginSettingsPrototype.
3. Bind plugin fields to config.* and use context.* for modal-level state and actions.
4. Settings are scoped per-project and per-agent automatically.

### Resolution Priority (Highest First)
1. project/.a0proj/agents/<profile>/plugins/<name>/config.json
2. project/.a0proj/plugins/<name>/config.json
3. usr/agents/<profile>/plugins/<name>/config.json
4. usr/plugins/<name>/config.json
5. plugins/<name>/default_config.yaml (fallback defaults)

## 5. Model Providers

Plugins can add or override model providers by placing a `conf/model_providers.yaml` inside their plugin directory. The file follows the same format as the main `conf/model_providers.yaml`.

At startup (and whenever a plugin is enabled/disabled), the system:
1. Loads the base `conf/model_providers.yaml`.
2. Discovers `conf/model_providers.yaml` from all enabled plugins.
3. Merges them in order — matching provider IDs are overwritten, new IDs are appended.

Example plugin provider file (`usr/plugins/my_plugin/conf/model_providers.yaml`):
```yaml
chat:
  my_custom_provider:
    name: My Custom LLM
    litellm_provider: openai
    kwargs:
      api_base: https://my-llm.example.com/v1

embedding:
  my_custom_embed:
    name: My Embeddings
    litellm_provider: openai
    kwargs:
      api_base: https://my-embed.example.com/v1
```

---

## 6. Plugin Activation Model

- Global and scoped activation are independent, with no inheritance between scopes.
- Activation flags are files: `.toggle-1` (ON) and `.toggle-0` (OFF).
- The plugin list shows a binary `ON`/`OFF` global activation switch.
- `always_enabled: true` in `plugin.yaml` forces ON and disables toggle controls in the UI.
- For plugins with project/profile scoping, the plugin config modal is the canonical per-scope activation surface.

---

## 7. Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| GET /plugins/<name>/<path> | Serve static assets |
| POST /api/plugins/<name>/<handler> | Call plugin API |
| POST /api/plugins | Management (actions: get_config, save_config, list_configs, delete_config, toggle_plugin, get_doc) |

---

## 8. Plugin Index & Community Sharing

The **Plugin Index** is a community-maintained repository at https://github.com/agent0ai/a0-plugins that lists plugins available to the Vini AI community. Plugins listed there can be discovered and installed by other users.

### Two Distinct Manifest Files

There are two completely different manifest files used at different stages. They must not be confused:

**Runtime manifest** (`plugin.yaml`, inside your plugin repo/directory — drives Vini AI behavior):
```yaml
name: my_plugin              # REQUIRED for index submission; must match index folder name
title: My Plugin
description: What this plugin does.
version: 1.0.0
settings_sections:
  - agent
per_project_config: false
per_agent_config: false
always_enabled: false
```

**Index manifest** (`index.yaml`, submitted to the `a0-plugins` repo under `plugins/<your_plugin_name>/` — drives discoverability only):
```yaml
title: My Plugin
description: What this plugin does.
github: https://github.com/yourname/your-plugin-repo
tags:
  - tools
  - example
screenshots:                    # optional, up to 5 full image URLs
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourname/your-plugin-repo/main/docs/screen.png
```

The index manifest is named `index.yaml` (not `plugin.yaml`). Required fields: `title`, `description`, `github`. Optional: `tags` (up to 5), `screenshots` (up to 5 URLs). The `github` field must point to the root of a GitHub repository that contains a runtime `plugin.yaml` at the repository root, and that `plugin.yaml` must include a `name` field matching the index folder name exactly. That repository must also include a `LICENSE` file at its root so community users have explicit terms of use.

### Repository Structure for Community Plugins

When creating a plugin intended for the community, the plugin should be a standalone GitHub repository where the plugin directory contents live at the repo root:

```text
your-plugin-repo/          ← GitHub repository root
├── plugin.yaml            ← runtime manifest (title, description, version, ...)
├── default_config.yaml
├── README.md
├── LICENSE                ← required for Plugin Index (community) plugins
├── api/
├── tools/
├── extensions/
└── webui/
```

Users install it locally by cloning (or downloading) the repo contents into `/a0/usr/plugins/<plugin_name>/`.

### Submitting to the Plugin Index

1. Create a GitHub repository for your plugin with the runtime `plugin.yaml` (including the `name` field) at the repo root.
2. Fork `https://github.com/agent0ai/a0-plugins`.
3. Create a folder `plugins/<your_plugin_name>/` containing only an `index.yaml` (and optionally a square thumbnail image ≤ 20 KB).
4. Open a Pull Request with exactly one new plugin folder.
5. CI validates the submission automatically. A maintainer reviews and merges.

Index submission rules:
- One plugin per PR
- Folder name: unique, stable, `^[a-z0-9_]+$` (lowercase, numbers, underscores — no hyphens)
- Folder name must exactly match the `name` field in your remote `plugin.yaml`
- Folders starting with `_` are reserved for internal use
- `github` must point to a public repo that contains `plugin.yaml` at its root with a matching `name` field
- The same repo must contain `LICENSE` at its root (community contribution requirement)
- `title` max 50 characters, `description` max 500 characters
- `index.yaml` total max 2000 characters
- `tags`: optional, up to 5, use recommended tags from https://github.com/agent0ai/a0-plugins/blob/main/TAGS.md
- `screenshots`: optional, up to 5 full image URLs (png/jpg/webp, each ≤ 2 MB)

### Plugin Hub

The Plugin Hub is provided by the always-enabled `_plugin_installer` plugin. Users can reach it from the **Plugins** dialog in two ways:

- the **Browse** tab in `webui/components/plugins/list/plugin-list.html`
- the **Install** toolbar action injected by `plugins/_plugin_installer/extensions/webui/plugins-list-header-buttons/install-buttons.html`, which opens `plugins/_plugin_installer/webui/main.html` on its own **Browse** tab

Both routes surface Plugin Index entries inside Vini AI. The Plugin Hub supports search, filtering, sorting, and a detail view with README content and installation actions.
