# Installation Guide

## **Goal:** Go from zero to a first working chat with minimal setup.

---

## Quick Start (Recommended)

The install script is the fastest way to get Vini AI running. It handles Docker, image pulling, and container setup automatically.

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bash.agent-zero.ai | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://ps.agent-zero.ai | iex
```

**Docker (run directly):**
```bash
docker run -p 80:80 agent0ai/agent-zero
```

Once the install completes, open the URL shown in your terminal to access the Web UI. Follow the prompts in the CLI to set your port and authentication, complete onboarding, add your API key, then continue to [Step 3: Configure Vini AI](#step-3-configure-agent-zero).

> [!TIP]
> Need Vini AI to reach host-machine files, shell, or a host browser? Install the optional [A0 CLI Connector](../guides/a0-cli-connector.md), then run `a0` to connect your terminal to this Vini AI instance.

---

## How to Update Vini AI

### Self Update (Recommended)

Use the built-in updater in the Web UI:

1. Open **Settings UI -> Update** tab
2. Open **Self Update**
3. Wait for the update checker to see if you have the latest version or if there's an available update. 

You'll also be prompted through the UI when a new A0 version is released. Backups are automatically managed internally during this process.

For technical details of the updater, see [Self Update](../guides/self-update.md).

### Updating from Pre-v0.9.8

If you are upgrading from Vini AI v0.9.8 or earlier to v1.1 or newer, use the migration path below. Older installs were laid out differently, so the in-app Self Update is not the right tool for that jump.

1. **Backup your existing `usr/` directory** (which contains your settings, projects, memory, and custom plugins).
2. **Run the new install script** to set up the current Docker-based install:
   - macOS / Linux: `curl -fsSL https://bash.agent-zero.ai | bash`
   - Windows (PowerShell): `irm https://ps.agent-zero.ai | iex`
3. **Migrate your data:** After the new installation completes, copy the contents of your backed-up `usr/` directory into the new `/a0/usr/` directory created by the script.
4. Restart the container for the changes to take effect.

### Manual Update (Advanced)

> Use this only if Self Update is unavailable or you must manage containers yourself (for example, some custom Docker setups).

1. Keep the current container running
2. `docker pull agent0ai/agent-zero:latest`
3. Start a **new** container on a different host port, for example: `docker run -d -p 50081:80 --name agent-zero-new agent0ai/agent-zero`
4. On the **old** instance: **Settings -> Backup & Restore -> Create Backup**
5. On the **new** instance: **Restore** the backup
6. Verify chats and data, then remove the old container

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not delete the old container until the new one has your data.

> [!TIP]
> If the new instance fails to load settings, remove `/a0/usr/settings.json` and restart to regenerate default settings.

---

## Manual Installation (Advanced)

> Users should use [Quick Start (Recommended)](#quick-start-recommended) above. The steps below are for custom Docker setups, air-gapped installs, or when you cannot use the install scripts.

Follow the steps below to install Docker and run the image by hand.

### Step 1: Install Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop provides the runtime environment for Vini AI, ensuring consistent behavior and security across platforms. The entire framework runs within a Docker container, providing isolation and easy deployment.

---

### Step 2: Run Vini AI

#### 2.1. Pull the Vini AI Docker Image

**Using Docker Desktop GUI:**

- Search for `agent0ai/agent-zero` in Docker Desktop
- Click the `Pull` button
- The image will be downloaded to your machine in a few minutes

![docker pull](../res/setup/1-docker-image-search.png)

**Using Terminal:**

```bash
docker pull agent0ai/agent-zero
```

#### 2.2. (Optional) Map Folders for Persistence

Choose or create a folder on your computer where Vini AI will save its data. 

Setting up persistence is needed only if you want your data and files to remain available even after you delete the container.

You can pick any location you find convenient:

- **Windows:** `C:\agent-zero-data`
- **macOS/Linux:** `/home/user/agent-zero-data`

You can map just the `/a0/usr` directory (recommended) or individual subfolders of `/a0` to a local directory.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do **not** map the entire `/a0` directory: it contains the application code and can break upgrades.

> [!TIP]
> Choose a location that's easy to access and backup. All your Vini AI data will be directly accessible in this directory.

#### 2.3. Run the Container

**Using Docker Desktop GUI:**

- In Docker Desktop, go to the "Images" tab
- Click the `Run` button next to the `agent0ai/agent-zero` image
- Open the "Optional settings" menu
- **Ensure at least one host port is mapped to container port `80`** (set host port to `0` for automatic assignment)
- Click the `Run` button

![docker port mapping](../res/setup/2-docker-image-run.png)
![docker volume mapping](../res/setup/2-docker-image-run-3.png)

The container will start and show in the "Containers" tab:

![docker containers](../res/setup/4-docker-container-started.png)

#### 2.4. Access the Web UI

The framework will take a few seconds to initialize. Find the mapped port in Docker Desktop (shown as `<PORT>:80`) or click the port right under the container ID:

![docker logs](../res/setup/5-docker-click-to-open.png)

Open `http://localhost:<PORT>` in your browser. The Web UI will open - Vini AI is ready for configuration!

![docker ui](../res/setup/6-docker-a0-running-new.png)

> [!TIP]
> You can also access the Web UI by clicking the port link directly under the container ID in Docker Desktop.

> [!NOTE]
> After starting the container, you'll find all Vini AI files in your chosen directory. You can access and edit these files directly on your machine, and the changes will be immediately reflected in the running container.

**Running A0 using Terminal?**

```bash
docker run -p 0:80 -v /path/to/your/work_dir:/a0/usr agent0ai/agent-zero
```

- Replace `0` with a fixed port if you prefer (e.g., `50080:80`)

---

## Step 3: Configure Vini AI

The UI will show a welcome banner when model setup is missing. Click
**Start Onboarding** to choose Cloud or Local, add a provider key or account
connection, and select your main and utility models. For the screenshot
walkthrough, see the [First-Run Onboarding guide](../guides/onboarding.md).

### Settings Configuration

Vini AI provides a comprehensive settings interface to customize various aspects of its functionality. Access the settings by clicking the "Settings" button with a gear icon in the sidebar.

### Agent Configuration

- **Agent Profile:** Select the default profile for new chats, such as `agent0`,
  `hacker`, or `researcher`.
- **Memory Subdirectory:** Select the subdirectory for agent memory storage, allowing separation between different instances.
- **Knowledge Subdirectory:** Specify the location of custom knowledge files to enhance the agent's understanding.

See the [Agent Profiles guide](../guides/agent-profiles.md) for the chat menu,
profile switching, and guided profile creation.

> [!NOTE]
> Since v0.9.7, custom prompts belong inside a specific agent profile rather
> than a shared `/prompts` folder. Most users should create profiles from the
> chat profile menu.

> [!NOTE]
> The Hacker profile is included in the main image. After launch, choose the **hacker** agent profile in Settings to make it the default for new chats, or switch the selected chat from the composer profile selector. The "hacker" branch is deprecated.

![settings](../res/setup/settings/1-agentConfig.png)

### Chat Model Settings

- **Provider:** Select the chat model provider (e.g., Anthropic)
- **Model Name:** Choose the specific model (e.g., claude-sonnet-4-5)
- **Context Length:** Set the maximum token limit for context window
- **Context Window Space:** Configure how much of the context window is dedicated to chat history

![chat model settings](../res/setup/settings/2-chat-model.png)

**Model naming is provider-specific.**

Use `claude-sonnet-4-5` for Anthropic, but use `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` for OpenRouter. If you see "Invalid model ID," verify the provider and naming format on the provider website, or search the web for "<name-of-ai-model> model naming".

> [!TIP]
> **Context window tuning:** Set the total context window size first (for example, 100k), then adjust the chat history portion as a fraction of that total. A large fraction on a very large context window can still be enormous.

> [!TIP]
> **API URL:** URL of the API endpoint for the chat model - only needed for some providers like Ollama, LM Studio, Azure, etc.

### Utility Model Configuration

- **Provider & Model:** Select a model for utility tasks like memory organization and summarization
- **Temperature:** Adjust the determinism of utility responses

> [!NOTE]
> Utility models need to be strong enough to extract and consolidate memory reliably. Very small models (e.g., 4B) often fail at this; 70B-class models or high-quality cloud "flash/mini" models work best.

### Embedding Model Settings [Optional]

- **Provider:** Choose the embedding model provider (e.g., OpenAI)
- **Model Name:** Select the specific embedding model (e.g., text-embedding-3-small)

> [!NOTE]
> Vini AI uses a local embedding model by default (runs on CPU), but you can switch to OpenAI embeddings like `text-embedding-3-small` or `text-embedding-3-large` if preferred.

### Built-in Voice Plugins

- Vini AI ships Whisper STT as the built-in `_whisper_stt` plugin and Kokoro TTS as the built-in `_kokoro_tts` plugin.
- Docker/bootstrap remains responsible for installing the required speech dependencies such as `ffmpeg`, Kokoro, Whisper, and `soundfile`.
- Both plugins can be enabled or disabled independently from the Agent Plugins section in the Web UI.
- Whisper model size, language, message handling, and silence behavior are configured from the plugin settings screen.
- If `_kokoro_tts` is disabled, spoken output falls back to the browser's native speech synthesis instead of the container runtime.

### API Keys

Configure API keys for various service providers directly within the Web UI. Click `Save` to confirm your settings.

> [!NOTE]
> **OpenAI API vs Plus subscription:** A ChatGPT Plus subscription does not include API credits. You must provide a separate API key for OpenAI usage in Vini AI.

> [!TIP]
> For OpenAI-compatible providers (e.g., custom gateways or Z.AI/GLM), add the API key under **External Services -> Other OpenAI-compatible API keys**, then select **OpenAI Compatible** as the provider in model settings.

> [!CAUTION]
> **GitHub Copilot Provider:** When using the GitHub Copilot provider, after selecting the model and entering your first prompt, the OAuth login procedure will begin. You'll find the authentication code and link in the output logs. Complete the authentication process by following the provided link and entering the code, then you may continue using Vini AI.

### Authentication

- **UI Login:** Set username for web interface access
- **UI Password:** Configure password for web interface security
- **Root Password:** Manage Docker container root password for SSH access

![settings](../res/setup/settings/3-auth.png)

### Development Settings

- **RFC Parameters (local instances only):** Configure URLs and ports for remote function calls between instances
- **RFC Password:** Configure password for remote function calls

Learn more about Remote Function Calls in the [Development Setup guide](dev-setup.md#step-6-configure-ssh-and-rfc-connection).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always keep your API keys and passwords secure.

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows host installs (non-Docker), you must use RFC to run shell code on the host system. The Docker runtime handles this automatically.

---

## Choosing Your LLMs

The Settings page is the control center for selecting the Large Language Models (LLMs) that power Vini AI. You can choose different LLMs for different roles:

| LLM Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `chat_llm` | This is the primary LLM used for conversations, agent reasoning, and tool use. Vision support controls image understanding. |
| `utility_llm` | This LLM handles internal tasks like summarizing messages, managing memory, and processing internal prompts. Using a smaller, less expensive model here can improve efficiency. |
| `embedding_llm` | The embedding model shipped with A0 runs on CPU and is responsible for generating embeddings used for memory retrieval and knowledge base lookups. Changing the `embedding_llm` will re-index all of A0's memory. |

**How to Change:**

1. Open Settings page in the Web UI.
2. Choose the provider for the LLM for each role (Main Model, Utility Model, Embedding Model) and write the model name.
3. Click "Save" to apply the changes.

> [!NOTE]
> The built-in Browser does not have a separate default model slot. The main agent decides when to call the direct `browser` tool. Browser settings can optionally choose a Browser LLM preset for Browser-owned helper operations.

### Important Considerations

#### Model Naming by Provider

Use the naming format required by your selected provider:

| Provider | Model Name Format | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI | Model name only | `claude-sonnet-4-5` |
| OpenRouter | Provider prefix mostly required | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` |
| Ollama | Model name only | `gpt-oss:20b` |

> [!TIP]
> If you see "Invalid model ID," verify the provider and naming format on the provider website, or search the web for "<name-of-ai-model> model naming".

#### Context Window & Memory Split

- Set the **total context window** (e.g., 100k) first.
- Then tune the **chat history portion** as a fraction of that total.
- Extremely large totals can make even small fractions very large; adjust thoughtfully.

#### Utility Model Guidance

- Utility models handle summarization and memory extraction.
- Very small models (about 4B) usually fail at reliable context extraction.
- Aim for ~70B class models or strong cloud "flash/mini" models for better results.

#### Reasoning/Thinking Models

- Reasoning can increase cost and latency. Some models perform better **without** reasoning.
- If a model supports it, disable reasoning via provider-specific parameters (e.g., Venice `disable_thinking=true`).

<a name="linux-ollama-installation"></a>
### <img src="../res/setup/oses/linux.png" width="30" alt="Linux"/> Linux Ollama Installation

Run the installation script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

Once installed, continue to [Pulling Models](#pulling-models).

---

### Pulling Models

**Finding Model Names:**

Visit the [Ollama model library](https://ollama.com/library) for a list of available models and their corresponding names. Ollama models are referenced by **model name only** (for example, `llama3.2`).

**Pull a model:**

```bash
ollama pull <model-name>
```

Replace `<model-name>` with the name of the model you want to use. For example: `ollama pull mistral-large`

### Configuring Ollama in Vini AI

1. Once you've downloaded your model(s), select it in the Settings page of the GUI.
2. Within the Chat model, Utility model, or Embedding model section, choose **Ollama** as provider.
3. Write your model code as expected by Ollama, in the format `llama3.2` or `qwen2.5:7b`
4. Provide your API base URL to your Ollama API endpoint, usually `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
5. Click `Save` to confirm your settings.

![ollama](../res/setup/settings/4-local-models.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If Vini AI runs in Docker and Ollama runs on the host, ensure port **11434** is reachable from the container. If both services are in the same Docker network, you can use `http://<container_name>:11434` instead of `host.docker.internal`.

### Managing Downloaded Models

**Listing downloaded models:**

```bash
ollama list
```

**Removing a model:**

```bash
ollama rm <model-name>
```

> [!TIP]
> Experiment with different model combinations to find the balance of performance and cost that best suits your needs. E.g., faster and lower latency LLMs will help, and you can also use `faiss_gpu` instead of `faiss_cpu` for the memory. 

---

## Using Vini AI on Your Mobile Device

Vini AI can be accessed from mobile devices and other computers using the built-in **Tunnel feature**.

### Recommended: Using Tunnel (Remote Access)

The Tunnel feature allows secure access to your Vini AI instance from anywhere:

1. Open Settings in the Web UI
2. Navigate to the **External Services** tab
3. Click on **Flare Tunnel** in the navigation menu
4. Click **Create Tunnel** to generate a secure HTTPS URL
5. Share this URL to access Vini AI from any device

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Security:** Always set a username and password in Settings -> Authentication before creating a tunnel to secure your instance on the internet.

For complete details on tunnel configuration and security considerations, see the [Remote Access via Tunneling](../guides/usage.md#remote-access-via-tunneling) section in the Usage Guide.

### Alternative: Local Network Access

If you prefer to keep access limited to your local network:

1. Find the mapped port in Docker Desktop (format: `<PORT>:80`, e.g., `32771:80`)
2. Access from the same computer: `http://localhost:<PORT>`
3. Access from other devices on the network: `http://<YOUR_COMPUTER_IP>:<PORT>`

> [!TIP]
> Find your computer's IP address with `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig`/`ip addr` (macOS/Linux). It's usually in the format `192.168.x.x` or `10.0.x.x`.

For developers or users who need to run Vini AI directly on their system, see the [In-Depth Guide for Full Binaries Installation](dev-setup.md).

---

## Advanced: Automated Configuration via Environment Variables

Vini AI settings can be automatically configured using environment variables with the `A0_SET_` prefix in your `.env` file. This enables automated deployments without manual configuration.

**Usage:**

Add variables to your `.env` file in the format:

```env
A0_SET_{setting_name}={value}
```

**Examples:**

```env
# Model configuration
A0_SET_chat_model_provider=anthropic
A0_SET_chat_model_name=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
A0_SET_chat_model_ctx_length=200000

# Memory settings
A0_SET_memory_recall_enabled=true
A0_SET_memory_recall_interval=5

# Agent configuration
A0_SET_agent_profile=custom
A0_SET_agent_memory_subdir=production
```

**Docker usage:**

When running Docker, you can pass these as environment variables:

```bash
docker run -p 50080:80 \
  -e A0_SET_chat_model_provider=anthropic \
  -e A0_SET_chat_model_name=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 \
  agent0ai/agent-zero
```

**Notes:**

- These provide initial default values when settings.json doesn't exist or when new settings are added to the application. Once a value is saved in settings.json, it takes precedence over these environment variables.
- Sensitive settings (API keys, passwords) use their existing environment variables
- Container/process restart required for changes to take effect

---

### Manual Migration (Legacy or Non-Docker)

If you are migrating from older, non-Docker setups, A0 handles the migration of legacy folders and files automatically at runtime. The right place to save your files and directories is `a0/usr`.

## Conclusion

After following the instructions for your specific operating system, you should have Vini AI successfully installed and running. You can now start exploring the framework's capabilities and experimenting with creating your own intelligent agents.
