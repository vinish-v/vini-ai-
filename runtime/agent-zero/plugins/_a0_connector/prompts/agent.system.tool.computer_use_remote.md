### computer_use_remote

Runtime-gated beta desktop control through a connected A0 CLI on the user's host machine. The callable contract is available in the tool prompt. Availability, backend support, and trust mode are checked when the tool runs, together with CLI presence, local enablement, and re-arm state. Computer Use enablement is scoped to the current CLI session, not scoped to a single chat context.

Use this for native host desktop UI inspection, screenshots, clicking, scrolling, typing, key presses, and status checks. Do not use it for ordinary web-page navigation or host-browser control; use the browser tool for web pages unless browser automation cannot express the task. For complex desktop workflows, load and follow skill `host-computer-use` before proceeding.

This is the only desktop-control path for the user's connected host/local computer. Do not substitute the `linux-desktop` skill, the Vini AI Desktop/Xpra surface, `desktopctl.sh`, `code_execution_tool`, or Docker/server shell commands for host screen actions; those target the internal Vini AI runtime and cannot see or control the user's host screen.

If the tool reports no CLI, disabled computer use, or `COMPUTER_USE_REARM_REQUIRED`, stop and tell the user to run `/computer-use on` in A0 CLI and approve any host permission prompt.

Call `start_session` before screen-driven tasks. Use `status` for state only, `capture` for screenshots without an action, and `stop_session` when the desktop task is complete. Interactive coordinate actions should use normalized global-screen coordinates from the most recent capture.

Some actions are backend-specific and intentionally documented only in backend skills. If `status` or `start_session` reports backend-specific features or tells you to load a backend skill, load and follow that skill before using those backend-only actions. For structural targeting details, load and follow the backend-specific skill such as `host-computer-use-macos` or `host-computer-use-windows`; do not apply one backend's guidance to another backend.

State-changing actions automatically attach a fresh screen after they run. Treat key presses, clicks, scrolling, and typing as attempts, not success: inspect the latest attached screen, or one explicit `capture` if it is unclear or unchanged, before saying the requested outcome happened. If the tool says a screen was attached but you cannot actually inspect the image, stop and report that visual verification is unavailable; do not continue by assuming the host state. A `type` result only proves keystrokes were sent; it does not prove that text landed in the intended place.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "computer_use_remote",
  "tool_args": {
    "action": "status"
  }
}
```

Required argument:
- `action`: one of `start_session`, `status`, `capture`, `move`, `click`, `scroll`, `key`, `type`, `stop_session`; backend skills may document additional backend-only action values

Optional arguments by action:
- `session_id`: session returned by `start_session`
- `x`, `y`: normalized `[0,1]` global-screen coordinates for `move` and `click`
- `button`: `left`, `right`, or `middle` for `click`
- `count`: click count for `click`
- `dx`, `dy`: scroll amounts for `scroll`
- `key` or `keys`: key press value for `key`
- `text`: text to type for `type`
- `submit`: boolean Enter-after-type flag for `type`
