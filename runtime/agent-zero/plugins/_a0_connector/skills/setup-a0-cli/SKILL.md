# A0 CLI Host Setup

Use this skill to guide the user through installing `a0` on their host machine and connecting it to Vini AI.

## Core Boundary

- Vini AI stays in Docker or its sandboxed runtime.
- `a0` installs and runs on the user's host machine.
- The whole point is to let Vini AI work on the real files on the user's computer.

## Response Flow

### 1. Ask whether they already tried

Start here:

> Have you already tried installing `a0`? If so, what command did you run, where did you run it, and what happened?

If they already tried, diagnose that attempt before repeating instructions.

### 2. Stop container installs immediately

If the user is inside the Vini AI container, `/a0`, `docker exec`, or another sandbox shell, stop and say:

> `a0` does not get installed inside the Vini AI container. Exit to your normal host terminal first. Vini AI stays in Docker; `a0` belongs on your machine.

Do not keep giving install commands until they are back on the host.

### 3. Identify the host OS only as needed

If the platform is unclear, ask one short question:

> Are you on macOS/Linux shell or Windows PowerShell on the host machine?

Then use the matching installer.

### 4. Use the installer-first flow

Treat these public installer URLs as placeholders for now. Use them first, but be ready to switch to the manual `uv tool install` path if the raw GitHub URL is blocked, private, or unreachable.

macOS / Linux:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agent0ai/a0-connector/main/install.sh | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agent0ai/a0-connector/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer will install `uv` if needed, then run `uv tool install --upgrade <package-spec>` for the CLI.

### 5. Use the manual `uv tool install` fallback when needed

If the placeholder installer URL is unavailable, switch to a manual `uv tool install` flow instead of stopping.

Public Git fallback:

```bash
uv tool install --upgrade git+https://github.com/agent0ai/a0-connector
```

Local checkout or internal mirror examples:

```bash
uv tool install --upgrade /path/to/a0-connector
uv tool install --upgrade git+ssh://git.example.com/team/a0-connector.git
```

If they want to reuse the stock installer with a custom package source, explain that the installer honors `A0_PACKAGE_SPEC`.

### 6. Tell them to run `a0`

After install, the next step is always:

```bash
a0
```

If the command is not found yet, tell them to open a new terminal and run `a0` again.

### 7. Explain how to connect

Tell the user what to expect:

- `a0` opens the host picker first.
- If Vini AI is running locally, `a0` may discover it automatically.
- If not, the user can enter the Vini AI web URL manually in the custom URL field.
- The custom URL can be either a normal address with a port, such as `http://localhost:50001`, or a tunnel URL.
- For Flare Tunnel, tell the user to open `Settings > External Services > Flare Tunnel`, click `Create Tunnel`, then copy and paste the HTTPS URL into `a0` exactly as shown.
- Tunnel URLs such as `https://example.trycloudflare.com` do not need a port appended.
- `AGENT_ZERO_HOST` can prefill the target host without bypassing the picker.

Example:

```bash
export AGENT_ZERO_HOST=http://localhost:50001
a0
```

Tunnel example:

```bash
export AGENT_ZERO_HOST=https://example.trycloudflare.com
a0
```

### 8. Define success clearly

Successful setup looks like this:

- `a0` starts on the host machine.
- It connects to the user's Vini AI instance or reaches the login step.
- The user can open a chat from the terminal.
- Vini AI can now act on real files on the host through the connector flow while Vini AI itself still runs in Docker.

## Troubleshooting

- If the user says they installed inside Docker or shows `/a0` paths, redirect them to the host-machine install.
- If `a0` gets a connector `404`, explain that the running Vini AI build likely does not include the builtin `_a0_connector` support yet and should be updated.
- If the browser UI works but `a0` does not, remind them the web UI can run without connector support but the CLI cannot.
- If Docker discovery does not find the instance, have them enter the exact Vini AI URL with `host:port`, or create a Flare Tunnel in `Settings > External Services > Flare Tunnel` and paste that HTTPS URL directly.

## Example Requests And Responses

### Example 1

User: "Help me set up the A0 CLI connector."

Respond like this:

1. Ask whether they already tried and whether they are on the host machine.
2. If the OS is unknown, ask whether they are in macOS/Linux shell or Windows PowerShell.
3. Give the matching installer command.
4. Tell them to run `a0`.
5. Explain what the host picker and successful connection should look like.

### Example 2

User: "I'm inside the Vini AI container. How do I install A0?"

Respond like this:

- Stop the flow.
- Explain that `a0` must be installed on the host, not in the container.
- Tell them to exit Docker, open a normal terminal on the machine, then continue with the host installer.

### Example 3

User: "The raw GitHub installer URL is blocked on our network."

Respond like this:

- Say the public installer URL is only a placeholder path.
- Switch to a manual `uv tool install --upgrade <package-spec>` flow.
- Offer examples for a local checkout, internal Git host, or the public Git URL if that one works.
- Then tell them to run `a0` and connect to Vini AI.
